# Copy Calico

In this assignment, we'll be copying an exiting website. Below you'll find a list of options. Don't worry, you don't have to copy of all them. You'll choose whichever you like to go about copying.

## Basic Setup

Create a repo, make HTML and CSS files, and get going!

Do NOT forget to **add a `link` tag from your HTML to your CSS**. 

Also, as you work, make at least three commits in git as you go with good, descriptive commit messages!

## List Of The Websites To Choose From:

- [Google](https://www.google.com/)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) (when you are logged out!)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) (again, when logged out!)
- [Ed Nacional](https://ednacional.com/)

## Guidelines

- You do NOT have to cover the whole page, just the "above the fold" section. That is, you don't have to do anything you'd have to scroll down to see! Start at the top and work your way down, and if you only get halfway down the page, that's acceptable. The farther you go, the more you'll learn!
- You don't have to do any fancy fonts or animations or videos. Feel free ot screenshot any videos so you can just use the still image. And save or screenshot any actual images, of course
- You CAN use your browser's Developer Tools, and we recommend you do! Every browser has them. (Though Safari's isn't as good, so... probably use something else?)
- While your Dev Tools will actually show you the HTML and CSS you could steal, getting it perfect isn't the point; learning is. Make yourself work on implementing the layout yourself, and then you can always check out the original code later.

## Stretch Goals

#### Fonts

Try adding a font to better match the site: https://fonts.google.com/

Upon selecting a font in Google Fonts, you'll be given `<link>` tags to import the fonts into the `<head>` of your HTML doc along with a CSS font-family property demonstrating how to apply the font. 

#### Round 2

Try another copying another one of the sites!
